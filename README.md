# CSV Viewer - Fresh Start

This folder is a clean restart based on `spec-csv.prd`.

## Structure
- `prd-csv.md`: Product requirements and design spec.
- `App/`: SwiftUI source files.

## Use in Xcode
1. Create a new macOS App project (SwiftUI + Swift).
2. Replace the generated files with the contents of `App/`.
3. Build and run.
